On November 18, Gemini 3.0 was released. The announcement itself wasn’t flashy—no big launch event, no deliberate hype. Yet for those paying attention in the industry, a quiet release like this often signals deeper shifts brewing beneath the surface.

Around the same time, a subtle detail emerged: OpenAI had previously explored inserting ads into ChatGPT, but that plan was put on hold. Instead, they redirected their focus back to the core model itself—not for marketing spectacle, but to ensure the fundamentals are solid.

For the past few years, OpenAI’s business model has been clear and steady: monetize through API access, turning their models into infrastructure for other products. From Copilot to various less-visible enterprise tools, these systems quietly generate revenue—like gradually building a road that more and more traffic passes over.

But recently, that road has encountered a fork.

With DeepSeek and the maturation of open-source models, many companies are exploring a different approach: start with ChatGPT for rapid prototyping, perform local fine-tuning, and gradually migrate to open-source models. This is not a confrontation—it’s a natural strategic choice, balancing long-term cost, control, and future flexibility.

If in the past, companies mainly asked, “How can we best leverage external capabilities?”, they are now asking: “What should we truly own for the long term?”

This shift reflects broader changes in the industry’s business models: one-off buyouts are declining, while subscription-based revenue is growing. Organizations no longer chase a single transaction; they seek stable, ongoing relationships. When core capabilities depend on external APIs, it becomes difficult to fully own your operational tempo.

Within this context, Gemini 3.0 offers a new kind of user experience—ad-free, deeply integrated, naturally embedded in everyday tools. It doesn’t shout for attention, but it quietly demonstrates that AI can lower the barrier to adoption more than many realize.

Once users become accustomed to this smooth, frictionless experience, returning to cluttered, distraction-heavy interfaces naturally feels cumbersome. This isn’t a difference in technical specs—it’s a lifestyle choice.

Today, AI competition is no longer one-dimensional. It spans data, ecosystems, user entry points, and control. Some aim for closed-loop dominance; others lean toward openness. Some expand their proprietary systems; others seek more flexible, independent paths.

Where we stand is unique: neither outsiders nor full participants, but in a position to clearly observe these shifts.

Years from now, when looking back, each release and pivot we witness today may be seen as an early signal of an era’s turning point. For that reason, I’m reopening my newsletter this winter—to document what I see and think. It is both participation and witness.

The era of AI is no longer a distant “soon-to-come” future.
It is here, quietly and persistently reshaping the world around us.
